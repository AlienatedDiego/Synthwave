# Synthwave

Synthwave is a genre of copyright-free electronic music influenced by 1980s movie, music, and video game soundtracks.

Synthwave is a retro genre inspired by the musical culture of the eighties, based on the use of synthesizers, although there are also pieces complemented
by the use of electric guitars, sax and other instruments widely used in the eighties. Although it began as a genre mostly instrumental
without rules or leaders that emerged outside the record system. In those early years the genre was known as outrun, in honor of the Out Run driving video game,
which became very popular in arcades. of the eighties and nineties. As a movement,
it was not until the appearance of YouTube (which played and still plays a fundamental role in the dissemination of the genre) that it came to be known as synthwave.
